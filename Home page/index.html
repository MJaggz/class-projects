<h1>Welcome to My website</h1>
<h2>About me:</h2>
<p>
 My name is Mohamed Jama. I am a sophomore majoring in Computer Science &amp; Engineering. I am the oldest of 4 in my family. Some of my hobbies include sleeping, playing video games, spending time with my family, and going on nature walks. My top two favorite movies of all time are Interstellar and A Silent Voice. One fun fact about me is that a couple summers ago, my family and I went to Kenya and spent some time with relatives. My favorite food of all time is pizza. One unique goal is that I want to learn how to ride a motorcycle by the time Iâ€™m 35.
